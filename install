How to install and run TDALAB 1.1.

System requirements
The toolbox is developped using MATLAB 2008a under 64bit Windows 7. We also tested it in OS X Mountain Lion and it works well.
* MATLAB 2010 or later is strongly receommended to get full of Tensor Toolbox's standard functionality. 
* Particularly, in earlier version of MATLAB, the syntax "[~,outputb]=func(...)" is not supported.
 
How to install
Step 1: Unzip the package to a folder named such as "TDALAB_Home".
Step 2: Make sure you have installed MATLAB Tensor Toolbox Version 2.4/2.5 and added it to the path of MATLAB. 
        Otherwise download it from 
            http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html [Free]
        and add it to the path of MATLAB.(You may also unzip it to a subfolder of TDALAB_Home. 
        When you run tdalab the path will be added automatically and removed after you exit tdalab.)
Step 3: Launch MATLAB and change the current path to the folder TDALAB_Home. Type 'tdalab' in the command line and run it.

Remarek: TDALAB also supports the main functions of the N-Way toolbox which is available at http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox 
          for free. If you want to use its functions, download it and simply unzip it to the subfolder 
          "TDALAB_Home/TDAlgs/nway". TDALAB will find it automatically.
